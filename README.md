# Visualyze-A-Project-Management-and-To-Do-Web-Application

A personal project made by me, Feil Jasper J. Doria.

Managing projects and keeping track of tasks can be challenging for individuals, whether in an academic environment or a business setting. Providing visual tools for managing and monitoring these tasks helps users easily see which tasks are completed, still in progress, or yet to be started. With Project “Visualyze”, creating project plans and keeping track of tasks that are needed to be completed, makes it easier for individuals and much more convenient.
